## ONE BUTTON GAME ASSIGNMENT --OR-- TWO COLOR GAME ASSIGNMENT (Due: 11.02.23)

Creating a game with restrictions is not only a design challenge meant to think about what constitutes meaningful interactivity (see: Saten & Zimmerman), but also forces a game developer to consider disability and gaming. 

- Because of mobility challenges, some gamers find it difficult to master the crazy button-mashing of some AAA games (that is, the big game companies that make some of the most popular games). A one-button game would be far more accessible to this kind of gamer.

- Consider the challenges of the blind or visually impaired: a game that could be read using text-to-speech software can be deeply involving (for example, some of the gamers in the documentary Get Lamp professed a deep love for early text adventures). 

- Visually impaired but still-sighted gamers might be able to see games that use high contrast in light and dark. Pixel games that use black and white are more accessible than games that employ more "realistic" graphics.

Your assignment is to construct either a ONE BUTTON GAME, or a TWO COLOR GAME. 

### ONE BUTTON GAME: 

Consider how to integrate the action of clicking or depressing a button (a mouse or trackpad touch, a key, spacebar, etc.) might be narratively or strategically embedded in game play. Consider the examples in the "One Button Game" chapter handout, or the examples below.

### TWO COLOR GAME: 

Consider how to limit your palette to two contrasting colors while integrating the restricted palette with a narrative/game mechanic. 

1. Use one of the following tools:

Bitsy (https://bitsy.org/)
Pulp (https://play.date/pulp/)
Pico-8 (https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)
Twine (https://twinery.org/)

2. Keep it simple!

A game with a very simple premise, no matter how short, could be very gratifying. Don't feel the need to create a sprawling narrative with multiple characters and scenes! 

Tips:

For a one-button game: consider the smallest gesture—a wave, tapping your foot, sneezing, smiling, breathing—and how these might constitute a mini-game.

For a two-color game: consider circumstances where you would be limited to light and dark vision (perhaps in the dark, underwater). Consider the use of patterns, silhouettes, and well-timed movement.

NOTE:

If you have an idea for a "one button game" that uses a different game-making software, or is essentially analog (NOT a video game), I'd like to hear it! Let me know what you're thinking (tfunk4@uic.edu)!

A template you can use for Twine Macros and Styling: [Macro_Madness.html](readings/Macro_Madness.html)

Exercise goals:

-	Construct branching narratives/non-linear narratives for interactive play using simple coding techniques (involving Twine, adapting HTML, CSS, etc.)
-	Practice creating different modes of interactivity through text and moving images
-	Think about different narrative structures (picaresque, gauntlet, quest, branch-and-bottleneck, etc.) 
-	Understand distinctions between “performance” and “performative”; critiquing types and effectiveness of interactivity

Instructions:
Using Twine, write a branching story with one or more of the following features:

1. Non-human (or better, non-animal) main character
2. Events out of chronological order
3. Multiple characters
4. Poem, not prose

Possibly avoid: life simulator, choose your own adventure tropes (walking around in a fictional world, fighting, dying etc.).

Requirements:
- Use the Twine Cookbook for additional help: https://twinery.org/cookbook/
- Use the Twine non-linear story platform to create a game.
- You can use the downloaded or online version. If you use the online version, you will need to save your work by choosing the “Publish to File” option in the settings tab. This will download an .html file that can be opened on any computer.

## Game Analysis Presentation (Due: Week 4, 9.12.23-9.14.23)

Format: 
- 5-10 minutes long
- use Google Slides for images
- videos less than 30 seconds (short clips, please!)

The presentation should include:

- a short introduction: how did you find this game? Why does it appeal to you? What kind of game is this?
- a short explanation of how the game is played
- The analysis:

Choose three of the following of Sicart's game characteristics, and explain how your game fulfills (or thwarts!) them. 

1. Play is contextual. (6)
2. Play is carnivalesque. (11)
3. Play is appropriative. (11)
4. Play is disruptive. (14)
5. Play is autotelic. (16)
6. Play is creative. (17)
7. Play is personal. (17)

- Conclusion: is there anything you'd like to change about the game? Are there house rules you use, or rules/aspects of this game that you apply to other games?

Tips:

- Consider how language is used around the game (Huizinga, Chapter 2). How do people refer to the game (does it have particular words associated with it? Are there memes associated with it (consider "Among Us" and the word "sus", for example). Does the game have made up words or concepts? Does it have a specialized lingo associated with it?
- Consider how this game may have impacted history and/or culture (Huizinga, Chapter 3). Is there some larger concept that this game mimics/represents/parodies (example: Katamari Damacy is a commentary on capitalism).
